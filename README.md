# Synthetic_Data_Generation
Synthetic data is artificially generated data that mimics real-world data. It is created by algorithms, models, or simulations rather than being collected from actual events or real-world scenarios.
Synthetic Data Generation: Getting Started
To get started with the task of Synthetic Data Generation, we need a dataset that we can use to feed into a Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) model, which will be trained to generate new data samples that will be similar to the original data and the relationships between the features in the original data.

I found an ideal dataset for this task, which contains daily records of insights into app usage patterns over time. Our goal will be to generate synthetic data that mimics the original dataset by ensuring that it maintains the same statistical properties while providing privacy for usersâ€™ actual usage behaviour.

You can download the dataset from https://github.com/ayushshinde19/Synthetic_Data_Generation/blob/main/screentime_analysis.csv
